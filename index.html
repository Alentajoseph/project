            Dedicated to Lord Surya, this 13th-century temple is an architectural marvel and
             the quintessential example of Oriyan form of architecture. It is believed that the 
             temple was constructed by King Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga Dynasty. 
             The shape of the temple is of a massive chariot with sumptuously engraved stone wheels,
              pillars and walls. A major part of the structure at present is in ruins. 
              The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site

          Apart from being known for its stunning architecture, this is the first garden-tomb on the Indian
           subcontinent. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site declared in 1993, and has undergone widespread 
           restoration work since then. The tomb was custom-built by Humayun's son Akbar during 1569-70,
            and is also the first structure to have made the use of red sandstone at a massive scale..
